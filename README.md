# Kahit Saan / Anywhere / Cualquier Lugar

**Because "anywhere" isn't a plan.**

A multilingual restaurant and café discovery app that helps you make actual decisions when you're hungry.

## 🎯 The Problem

We've all been there:
- "Where should we eat?" 
- "I don't know, anywhere is fine."
- *30 minutes later, still haven't decided*

When people say "anywhere," they usually end up nowhere. **Anywhere** solves this by giving you real options instead of indecision.

## ✨ Features

### 🌍 Global Search
- Find restaurants, cafes, and bars anywhere in the world
- Search by city or use your current location
- Powered by OpenStreetMap data

### 🌐 Multilingual Support
Three languages, three personalities:
- **English:** "Anywhere" - Because "anywhere" isn't a plan.
- **Spanish:** "Cualquier Lugar" - Porque "cualquier lugar" no es un plan.
- **Filipino:** "Kahit Saan" - Dahil ang hirap ng kahit saan.

### 🔍 Smart Features
- Filter by type: Restaurants, Cafes, or Bars
- Get 3 random suggestions to make the choice easier
- Direct links to Google Maps for viewing and directions
- See cuisine types, addresses, and phone numbers (if available)

3. **Pick your vibe** - What are you in the mood for? (Restaurants, Cafes, or Bars)
4. **Get suggestions** - Receive 3 curated options nearby
5. **Explore** - View on map or get directions instantly
